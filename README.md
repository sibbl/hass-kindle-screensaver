# Home Assistant Kindle Screensaver

This tool can be used to display an overview of your Home Assistant instance on e.g. a [jailbroken](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=236104) Kindle device.

## Demo

## Features

It displays the current temperature and renders the history of the last 24hrs and the forecast of a weather component in a graph.

You might have to get used to the visualization, but the intention was to have the there values (history, now, forecast) in one single diagram, as this allows a comparison of the values. You can then ask yourself whether you can wear the same like yesterday or dress warmer or cooler.

Every minute, an image is generated from a website which is rendered by react. This image is converted into a format, which the Kindle e-ink screens can display. The device can then download the image and display it.

## Usage

You may simple set up the [sibbl/hass-kindle-screensaver](https://hub.docker.com/r/sibbl/hass-kindle-screensaver) docker container. It runs the server on port 5000 and can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `HA_HOST=https://your-hass-instance.com`
- `HA_PORT=443`
- `HA_TOKEN=eyJ0...` (you need to create this token in Home Assistant first)
- `HA_ENTITY_TEMPERATURE=sensor.outdoor_temperature` (state of this entity is displayed as current temperature)
- `HA_ENTITY_WEATHER=weather.openweathermap` (temperature and forecast attributes of this entity are used in the graph)
- `MOMENT_TIMEZONE=Europe/London` (used for date/time calculations)
- `MOMENT_LANGUAGE=en-US` (used for date/time formatting)

You may also simply use the `docker-compose.yml` file inside this repository, configure everything in there and run `docker-compose up`.
